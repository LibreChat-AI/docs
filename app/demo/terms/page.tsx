          <h2>5. User-Generated Content</h2>

          <h3>5.1 Your Content</h3>
          <p>
            &ldquo;User Content&rdquo; means any text, files, images, or other material you submit,
            upload, or input to the Service, including conversation messages and file attachments.
            You retain ownership of your User Content.
          </p>
          <p>
            By submitting User Content, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
            worldwide license to store, process, and transmit your content solely for the purpose of
            operating the Service. This license terminates when your content is deleted from the
            Service.
          </p>

          <h3>5.2 Content Responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for your User Content. We do not pre-screen, monitor, or
            endorse User Content. We act as a passive hosting provider and do not exercise editorial
            control over content submitted by users.
          </p>

          <h3>5.3 Content Removal and Reporting</h3>
          <p>
            In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (the Digital Services Act,
            &ldquo;DSA&rdquo;), we provide mechanisms for reporting illegal content. If you believe
            any content on the Service is illegal or violates these Terms, you may report it by
            contacting us at the address specified in Section 14.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon receiving a valid notice of illegal content, we will act expeditiously to assess
            the report and, where appropriate, remove or disable access to the content in question.
            We will inform the reporting party and, where feasible, the content uploader of any
            action taken and the reasons for it.
          </p>

          <h3>5.4 Repeat Infringers</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly
            violate these Terms or who are the subject of repeated valid reports of illegal content.
          </p>

          <h2>6. AI-Generated Output</h2>
          <p>
            The Service provides access to third-party artificial intelligence models. AI-generated
            output (&ldquo;AI Output&rdquo;) may be inaccurate, incomplete, biased, or otherwise
            unreliable. You acknowledge and agree that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              AI Output does not constitute professional advice of any kind (legal, medical,
              financial, or otherwise).
            </li>
            <li>You are solely responsible for evaluating and using AI Output.</li>
            <li>
              We do not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or fitness for any
              particular purpose of AI Output.
            </li>
            <li>
              AI Output may be subject to the terms and conditions of the underlying AI model
              providers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            The LibreChat software is open-source and licensed under the MIT License. These Terms do
            not grant you any additional rights to the LibreChat trademark, logo, or brand assets
            beyond what the MIT License permits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third-party AI model providers retain all rights to their respective models, and use of
            those models through the Service is subject to their terms of service.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
          <p>As this is a demonstration service:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Conversation data, uploaded files, and account information may be deleted at any time
              without prior notice.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may implement automatic data retention limits. Currently, uploaded files may be
              retained for up to 30 days before automatic deletion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Account data is retained while your account is active. Upon account deletion, we will
              remove your personal data within 30 days, subject to any legal obligations requiring
              longer retention.
            </li>
            <li>
              We perform periodic cleanups of the Demo database. Your conversations and data may not
              persist indefinitely.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
