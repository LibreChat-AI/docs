              <Link href="/robots.txt">robots.txt</Link>. Reasonable, well-behaved crawlers (for
              example, search-engine and AI-training crawlers that respect <code>robots.txt</code>)
              are welcome.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the Site to publish, transmit, or facilitate unlawful, harmful, defamatory, or

            <li>
              Use the Site in any way that violates export-control, sanctions, intellectual

            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Privacy and Analytics</h2>
          <p>
            Your privacy is governed by our <Link href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link> and{' '}
            <Link href="/cookie">Cookie Policy</Link>, which are incorporated into these Terms by
            reference. The Site uses privacy-preserving, self-hosted analytics and, only with your
            affirmative consent, may use Reo.dev first-party cookies for website and documentation
            performance analytics. You can reject or later withdraw optional analytics without
            losing access to the Site.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
          <p>
            The Site contains links and references to third-party services, software, and websites
            (for example, package registries, model providers, infrastructure vendors, and community
            forums). We are not responsible for the content, accuracy, availability, terms, or
            privacy practices of any third-party service, and your use of those services is governed
            by their own terms and policies.
          </p>

          <h2>9. User Contributions</h2>
          <p>
            If you submit a contribution to the Site &mdash; for example, a documentation pull
            request, an issue, or a comment &mdash; through the project&apos;s public repositories,
            you do so under the terms of the relevant repository&apos;s <code>LICENSE</code> file
            and contribution guidelines. You represent that you have the right to submit the
            contribution and grant the licenses required by those documents.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            Except for content explicitly licensed under the MIT License or another license stated
            on the relevant page, all rights in and to the Site, including its design, arrangement,
            and selection of content, remain the property of the LibreChat project maintainers and
            their contributors. Nothing in these Terms transfers ownership of third-party
            intellectual property referenced in the documentation.
          </p>

          <h2>11. No Warranty</h2>
          <p>
            The Site and its content are provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo;
            without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. To the fullest
            extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, including warranties of
            merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy,
            completeness, and uninterrupted or error-free operation. Documentation may contain
            technical inaccuracies or typographical errors and may be updated at any time without
            notice.
          </p>

          <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the LibreChat
            project maintainers, contributors, or affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental,
            special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits,
            revenues, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection
            with your access to, use of, or inability to use the Site, even if advised of the
            possibility of such damages. To the extent that liability cannot be excluded, our
            aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Site is limited to
            the greater of (a) the amount you paid us to use the Site (which is zero) and (b) USD
            one hundred (US&nbsp;$100).
          </p>
          <p>
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or
            exclusion of liability for certain damages; in those jurisdictions the foregoing
            limitations apply only to the maximum extent permitted by law, and nothing in these
            Terms limits any rights you have that cannot be lawfully limited.
          </p>

          <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the
            LibreChat project maintainers, contributors, and affiliates from and against any claims,
            damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&apos; fees)
            arising out of your use of the Site in violation of these Terms or applicable law.
          </p>

          <h2>14. Availability and Changes to the Site</h2>
          <p>
            We may modify, suspend, relocate, or discontinue all or part of the Site at any time
            without notice. We are not liable for any unavailability of the Site or for the loss of
            any content or links resulting from such changes. Where reasonable, we will redirect
            content that has moved.
          </p>

          <h2>15. Changes to These Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in the Site, in our
            practices, or in applicable law. Material changes will be reflected in the &ldquo;Last
            updated&rdquo; date at the top of this page and, where appropriate, communicated more
            prominently. Your continued use of the Site following any update constitutes your
            acceptance of the revised Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>16. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the LibreChat
            maintainers organize their operations, without regard to that jurisdiction&apos;s
            conflict-of-laws principles. Where you are a consumer protected by mandatory local law,
            those protections take precedence over this clause to the extent required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before initiating any formal proceeding, the parties agree to attempt in good faith to
            resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Site through
            informal communication, including by opening an issue in the project repository or by
            contacting us at the address below.
          </p>

          <h2>17. Severability and Entire Agreement</h2>
          <p>
            If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision
            will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will
            remain in full force and effect. These Terms, together with the{' '}
            <Link href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link> and the{' '}
            <Link href="/cookie">Cookie Policy</Link>, constitute the entire agreement between you
            and us regarding the Site and supersede any prior agreements on the same subject.
          </p>
